# `phack.`
*phack around and find out!*

`phack.` is a small project intended to run locally on a developers machine.

I am creating this to allow myself the freedom to experiment with things and get some
experience outside of work without the burdon of worrying about structure or
messy directories or system bloat.

As this project develops I will create some instructions on how to use it.
